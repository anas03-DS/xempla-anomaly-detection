# Anomaly Detection in Pump Sensor Data

This project was built as part of an application for an ML role at Xempla.  
It uses an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies (potential faults) in real-world sensor data from a pump system.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn (Isolation Forest)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Sensor readings collected from a mechanical pump system  
(Data Source: Kaggle - Pump Sensor Data)

## ðŸš€ What the Model Does
- Scales multivariate sensor data
- Applies Isolation Forest to detect unusual behavior
- Visualizes anomalies on selected sensors (e.g., `sensor_49`)

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output
Red dots represent detected anomalies:

## ðŸ¤– Why This Matters
This approach helps identify early signs of faults or unusual patterns in facility systems, aligned with Xemplaâ€™s focus on intelligent fault detection.
